# Model-of-vehicles-based-on-discrete-constraints
It is the model MATLAB code of article 'Modelling and dynamic analysis of vehicles based on discrete constraints', International Journal of Vehicle Design, January 2017. Discrete constraints model and classical model are involved.
Run file mymode2.m can get the result.
File mymode1.m is the function to describe the parameter system.

In this paper, a novel approach to modelling and dynamic analysis of full vehicle is proposed based on Udwadia-Kalaba theory. Because the vehicle is hierarchically modelled by using this approach, this approach is easily processed when handling the modelling of many-degrees-of-freedom vehicle. Also, the analytical dynamic model based on this approach is free of calculation of Lagrangian multiplier as used in the Lagrangian equation. To verify this approach, a 15 DOF vehicle is modelled in this paper by using Udwadia-Kalaba theory. Four tyresâ€™ displacement is exerted and the vertical dynamic behaviour of each subsystem is simulated and analysed in MATLAB. By solving Udwadia-Kalaba equation, the response of each subsystem is acquired. The simulation result is well coincident with that of the Lagrangian model, which verifies the proposed approach.
